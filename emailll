Subject: Request for Adding Access to Project Collection Administrator Group

Hi [Teammate's Name],

I hope you're doing well. Iâ€™m reaching out to request your assistance with access management in Azure DevOps.

Could you please add both Jack and me to the Project Collection Administrator group in the AHOrg organization? We need this access to manage the pipelines and environments at the organization level for the ROSS project.

Your help in getting this set up would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you!

Best regards,
[Your Name]

Azure DevOps CI/CD Cost Estimation
Project Overview
This document provides a cost estimation for implementing a CI/CD pipeline in Azure DevOps using self-hosted agents. The estimation covers the cost of pipelines and artifact storage based on current Azure pricing.

Pipeline Configuration
Number of Pipelines: 4
Agent Type: Self-hosted
Cost Breakdown
1. Pipelines Cost
Self-hosted Agent Cost: $15 per extra parallel job with unlimited minutes.
Base Cost: $45 per month.
Given the 4 pipelines:

Total Cost for 4 Pipelines:
$45 base cost per month.
No additional charges for self-hosted agent usage.
Total Monthly Pipeline Cost: $45

2. Artifact Storage Cost
Storage Used: 20 GB
Pricing Structure:
0 - 2 GiB = Free
2 - 10 GiB = $2 per GiB
10 - 100 GiB = $1 per GiB
Cost Calculation:

First 2 GiB: Free
Next 8 GiB (2 - 10 GiB): 8 GiB * $2/GiB = $16
Remaining 10 GiB (10 - 20 GiB): 10 GiB * $1/GiB = $10
Total Monthly Artifact Storage Cost: $26

Summary of Monthly Costs
Pipelines Cost: $45
Artifact Storage Cost: $26
Total Estimated Monthly Cost: $71

Notes
The cost estimation is based on current Azure DevOps pricing and may vary with changes in usage or pricing structure.
This estimation assumes a stable usage pattern without additional pipeline runs or storage needs.
